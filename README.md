# assignment01bca
This is the first assignment of Blockchain. The purpose is to create a package that helps in creating and monitoring of blocks in blockchain.

When verifying the blockchain, if the latest block is changed, the blockchain will still remain valid. Only if there is a block next to the block you change, will the blockchain become invalid. This is because the block's hash will need be compared to the previous hash in the next block. For latest block, this will not work.

Thank you.
